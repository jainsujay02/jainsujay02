### Hi, I'm Sujay ðŸ‘‹


I am a senior at UCLA majoring in Computer Engineering. 

Over the last four years, I've had pleasure of leading [ ACM at UCLA](https://https://www.uclaacm.com/), and teaching Python in underserved schools in LA through [ACM TeachLA](https://https://teachla.uclaacm.com/). In my free time, I like to be outdoors and do [photography](https://https://www.sujayphotography.com/). 

This summer, I'll be starting a new job as a data engineer at GoodRx.
